	\section{Getting Started with JabRef}
		Now that we've outlined the key features of JabRef, let's embark on a comprehensive guide on how to get started with JabRef. 
		This step-by-step walkthrough will cover everything from installation to creating a new bibliography and populating it with references.

		\subsection{Installation}
			The initial step in utilizing JabRef is to install the software on your system. 
			For all users, regardless of OS, the easiest way to download JabRef is to visit their website: \url{https://www.jabref.org/}.
			Once there select `Download' from the navigation bar, and press the ``Download JabRef'' button. 
			This will take you to the FossHub page where you can select the appropriate version for your OS and download and install it.

		\subsection{Creating a New Bibliography}
			Once JabRef is successfully installed, launch the application. 
			When the program loads you will be faced with a window that looks like the one shown in \Cref{fig:JabRefProgram}.
			
			\begin{figure}[htbp]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{example-image}
				\caption{This is an example of a single figure.}
				\label{fig:JabRefProgram}
			\end{figure}
			
			Now that the program is open, to create a new bibliography:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Click on `File $\rightarrow$ New Library' to create a new reference database.
			\end{enumerate}
			To save the database:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Click on `File $\rightarrow$ Save Library'.
				\item Choose an appropriate and location.
				\item Click `Save'.
			\end{enumerate}
			Congratulations! You've initiated your bibliography using JabRef. 
			Now that we have this created, the next step is to add references to the database.

		\subsection{Adding References}
			JabRef offers multiple avenues for adding references to your database.
			Some of the methods are generally more useful than others but we will go over a few that you are likely to use:

			\subsubsection{Web Search}
				JabRef's integrated web search feature simplifies the process of importing references from online sources.
				This is by-far the easiest way to enter a reference.
				
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Click on `Web Search'.
					\item Search for the desired reference using the integrated search feature.
					\item Select the reference all the references you wish to import.
					\item Click `Import entries' to import the selected entries.
					\item The references are added to your library.
				\end{enumerate}
				
			\subsubsection{Manual Entry}
				To manually enter a reference:

				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Click Library $\rightarrow$ `New entry' or use the shortcut `Ctrl + N'.
					\item Choose the entry type (\textit{e.g.}, article, book, inproceedings).
					\item Fill in the required fields like author, title, journal, \textit{etc}.
				\end{enumerate}
				

				By following these steps, you can efficiently populate your JabRef database with the necessary references.

		\subsection{Organizing References}
			Effectively organizing references is essential for a streamlined bibliography. 
			JabRef's grouping feature allows you to categorize references based on your preferences:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item On the left panel, select `Add Group`.
				\item Give the group an appropriate name.
				\item Optionally you can add a Description, Icon, Colour, \textit{etc}.
			\end{enumerate}
			
			To assign a reference to a group:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Select the Reference(s) from the center list.
				\item Drag them to the group on the left of the screen.
			\end{enumerate}
			\note{Groups can even be nested into groups to provide more levels of organization.}
			Organizing references into groups enhances accessibility and facilitates a more systematic approach to bibliography management.

	\section{Example: Building a Bibliography}
