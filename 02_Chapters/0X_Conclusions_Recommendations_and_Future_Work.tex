  % \printreferences Prints a reference section at the end of the current chapter
  %
  % If the `chapterbib' option is not declared, \printreferences does nothing
  %    This allows you to turn end of chapter references on and off easily.
  %
  % Note: End of chapter references share references with the Bibliography that
  %    is REQUIRED at the end of your thesis, so the numbering of the end of 
  %    chapter references may not start at 1 and may not increment by one.
