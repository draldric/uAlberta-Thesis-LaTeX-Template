	\section{Getting Started with JabRef}
		Now that we've outlined the key features of JabRef, let's embark on a comprehensive guide on how to get started with JabRef. 
		This step-by-step walkthrough will cover everything from installation to creating a new bibliography and populating it with references.

		\subsection{Installation}
			The initial step in utilizing JabRef is to install the software on your system. 
			For all users, regardless of OS, the easiest way to download JabRef is to visit their website: \url{https://www.jabref.org/}.
			Once there select `Download' from the navigation bar, and press the ``Download JabRef'' button. 
			This will take you to the FossHub page where you can select the appropriate version for your OS and download and install it.

				\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{\insertimage{JabRef_Main_Window.png}}
				\caption{JabRef Main Window.}
				\label{fig:JabRefProgram}
			\end{figure}
			Now that the program is open, to create a new bibliography:
			\begin{enumerate}

				\item Click `Save'.
			\end{enumerate}
			Congratulations! You've initiated your bibliography using JabRef. 
			Now that we have this created, the next step is to add references to the database.

		\subsection{Adding References}
			JabRef offers multiple avenues for adding references to your database.
			Some of the methods are generally more useful than others but we will go over a few that you are likely to use:

			\subsubsection{Web Search}
				JabRef's integrated web search (see \Cref{fig:JabRefWebSearch}) feature simplifies the process of importing references from online sources.
				This is by-far the easiest way to enter a reference.
				
				\begin{figure}[htbp]
					\centering
					\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{\insertimage{JabRef_Web_Search.png}}
					\caption{JabRef Web Search Tool.}
					\label{fig:JabRefWebSearch}
				\end{figure}
				
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Click on `Web Search'.
					\item Search for the desired reference using the integrated search feature.
					\item Select the reference all the references you wish to import,as shown in \Cref{fig:JabRefWebSearchResults}.
					\item Click `Import entries' to import the selected entries.
					\item The references are added to your library.
				\end{enumerate}
				
				\begin{figure}[htbp]

					\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{\insertimage{JabRef_Example_Web_Search.png}}
					\caption{Example Web Search Results for \texttt{``OSM-Classic''}.}
					\label{fig:JabRefWebSearchResults}
				\end{figure}
				
				\note{The Web Search tool by default uses a general search, however, a specific database can be chosen as well using the drop down arrow next to ``Search Selected''.}
				
			\subsubsection{Manual Entry}
				Manually adding a reference can be done in a `manual' and `automatic' way.
				When adding a new entry you will be faced with the option to select an entry type or to enter an ID (DOI, ArXiv, ISBN, \textit{etc.}).
				If you enter an ID, the information for the reference will be automatically pulled from the internet.
				Otherwise to manually enter all the information for a reference:

				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Click Library $\rightarrow$ `New entry' or use the shortcut `Ctrl + N' and this will show the following window.%
						\begin{center}%

						\end{center}%
					\item Choose the entry type (\textit{e.g.}, article, book, inproceedings).
					\item Fill in the required fields like author, title, journal, \textit{etc}.
				\end{enumerate}
				
				By following these steps, you can efficiently populate your JabRef database with the necessary references.

		\subsection{Organizing References}
			Effectively organizing references is essential for a streamlined bibliography. 
			JabRef's grouping feature allows you to categorize references based on your preferences:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item On the left panel, select `Add Group`.
				\item Give the group an appropriate name.
				\item Optionally you can add a Description, Icon, Colour, \textit{etc}.
			\end{enumerate}
			
			To assign a reference to a group:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Select the Reference(s) from the centre list.
				\item Drag them to the group on the left of the screen.
			\end{enumerate}
			\note{Groups can even be nested into groups to provide more levels of organization.}
			Organizing references into groups enhances accessibility and facilitates a more systematic approach to bibliography management.

	\section{Exploring Advanced Features of JabRef}

		In this section, we'll explore some of the advanced features that enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of JabRef as a reference manager.

		\subsection{Quality Assurance: Checking and Correcting Entries}
			Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of references is crucial. 
			JabRef provides tools for quality assurance, allowing users to check and correct entries.

			To check for duplicate entries:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Click on `Quality $\rightarrow$ Find duplicates'.
				\item JabRef will identify and display duplicate entries.
			\end{enumerate}
			
			To correct entries:
			\begin{enumerate}

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Open the entry editor for a reference.
				\item Click on `General' and use the `PDF' or `File' field to link the document.
			\end{enumerate}
			This integration helps to streamline the retrieval of PDF's or other associated documents directly from JabRef.
			Further, this allows JabRef to keep track of the comments and highlights in a single place (see \Cref{fig:JabRefFileAnnotations}).
			These annotations can be found by selecting the entry, and selecting the `File annotations' tab.

			JabRef keeps track of a lot of information and can even help you with your research.
			Some additional information JabRef provides includes:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Citation information
				\item Citation relationships (what the reference cites and who has cited the reference). 
					This further lets you open the links to the reference's source, or even add these references directly to your library.
				\item If one right clicks an entry you are provided the following options:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Rank - rank the reference with one to five stars.
						\item Toggle Relevance - add a marker to show this is a relevant source.
						\item Priority - rank items as low, medium, or high priority.
