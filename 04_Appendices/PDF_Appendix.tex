\chapter{Inserting PDFs}\label{sec:motorSpecs}
	\note{The PDFs are inserted at 85\% their full size to ensure that they don't overlap any GPS page formatting required for the headers and footers.}\\

	\warning{While it is possible to have horizontal pages have the page numbers centered on the bottom long edge, I \textit{DO NOT} recommended it. This is because, while it looks okay in a digital format, this is not suitable for printing... this would print page numbers on the side of the page rather than consistently on the bottom.}\\
