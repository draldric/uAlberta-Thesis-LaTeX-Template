\abstracttext{%
    A thesis must have an abstract. 
    The abstract comes after the title page and is marked page ``ii''.

    The abstract is a concise and accurate summary of the thesis. 
    It states the problem that was researched, the methods of investigation, and the general conclusions. 
    An abstract must not contain non-text content, such as tables, graphs, complex equations, or illustrations.
    Even for theses containing journal articles, there is one single abstract for the entire work, included within the preliminary pages (front pages) of the thesis.

    For any thesis that is permitted to be written in a language other than English, two abstracts must be included; the first in English and the second in the language of the thesis.

    The font used for the abstract must be at least a 10 point font, with the text double-spaced, to ensure readability. 
    A strict maximum word count of 700 words applies, regardless of whether the abstract is for a master's or a doctoral degree (many abstracts are 300--500 words).

    For reference, this section is exactly one-hundred and seventy-six words.
