\acknowledgementtext{%
	An Acknowledgements page (no more than 2 pages in length) is a recommended, but not mandatory, component of a thesis.
	
	The Acknowledgements page serves as a place within a thesis where students may wish to acknowledge the provision of funding from third parties, such as an external scholarship bodies, research granting agencies, and foreign governments. 
	It is also appropriate to recognize the assistance provided by the supervisor and members of the supervisory committee.
	
	\latin{e.g. } I would like to thank Daniel R. Aldrich for his continuing contributions to the University of Alberta, and for his work within the graduate student community. More specifically, I would like to acknowledge the work that he put into creating the \LaTeX{} template that this thesis was created in, and the ongoing support that he provides to the students at the University of Alberta.
