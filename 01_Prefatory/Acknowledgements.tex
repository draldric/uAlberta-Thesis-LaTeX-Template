\acknowledgementtext{%
	While I would love to acknowledge every individual who has influenced this document, I realize that doing so might mean this document never gets finished.

	I want to extend my deepest gratitude to my friends and family for their unwavering support throughout all my accomplishments.

	A special thank-you goes out to the developers and other \LaTeX\ users who have contributed to the \LaTeX\ community. 
	Without their work, this guide wouldn't exist in its current form.

	I am also incredibly thankful to everyone who provided feedback and support along the way, including those new to \LaTeX. 
	Your fresh perspectives were invaluable in motivating the transformation from the previous version of this template into a full-fledged class, template, and this newly added guide to writing a thesis, complete with examples of the most requested elements to include.
