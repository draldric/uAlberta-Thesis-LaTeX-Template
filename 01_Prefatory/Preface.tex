	Writing a thesis is no small task, and as a graduate student at the University of Alberta, I quickly realized just how challenging it can be to meet all the formatting requirements while also producing a document that looks professional. 
	Like many others, I started out using traditional word processors, but it didn't take long before I ran into the usual headachesâ€”crashes, file corruption, and formatting issues that seemed to have a mind of their own.

	These frustrations led me to explore \LaTeX\ as an alternative. 
	I discovered that \LaTeX\ not only provided a way to keep my content and formatting separate but also offered a more reliable and consistent way to produce a high-quality thesis. 
	The learning curve was steep, but once I got the hang of it, I found it to be a game-changer.

	The original template document was born out of my experience with \LaTeX\ and the desire to make the thesis-writing process a bit less daunting for others who might be in the same boat. 
	My goal here with this new document is to provide a comprehensive guide that not only walks you through the basics of \LaTeX\ but also gives you practical examples and best practices\footnote{These might not be the ``best'' practices, however, these are practices that I follow to make my work more constant.} to follow.

	I built this template and class from the ground up with the aim of reducing the typical \LaTeX\ learning curve. 
	I've tried to keep it as simple as possible while still making it powerful enough to handle everything you'll need for a thesis. 
	I hope this document makes your life a little easier and that you find \LaTeX\ as useful as I have.
