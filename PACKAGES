array
    An extended implementation of the array and tabular environments which extends the options for column formats, and provides "programmable" format specifications.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/array

nomencl   
    Produces lists of symbols using the capabilities of the MakeIndex program.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/nomencl

etoolbox   
    The package is a toolbox of programming facilities geared primarily towards LATEX class and package authors.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/etoolbox

lipsum   
    his package gives you easy access to the Lorem Ipsum dummy text; an option is available to separate the paragraphs of the dummy text into TEX-paragraphs.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/lipsum

xmpincl   
    The XMP (eXtensible Metadata platform) is a framework to add metadata to digital material to enhance the workflow in publication.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/xmpincl

xcolor   
    The package starts from the basic facilities of the color package, and provides easy driver-independent access to several kinds of color tints, shades, tones, and mixes of arbitrary colors. It allows a user to select a document-wide target color model and offers complete tools for conversion between eight color models.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/xcolor

graphicx   
    The package builds upon the graphics package, providing a key-value interface for optional arguments to the \includegraphics command. This interface provides facilities that go far beyond what the graphics package offers on its own.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
    
tabularx   
    The package defines an environment tabularx, an extension of tabular which has an additional column designator, X, which creates a paragraph-like column whose width automatically expands so that the declared width of the environment is filled. (Two X columns together share out the available space between them, and so on.)
    https://ctan.org/pkg/tabularx

makecell   
    This package supports common layouts for tabular column heads in whole documents, based on one-column tabular environment. In addition, it can create multi-lined tabular cells.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/makecell

subcaption   
    The package provides a means of using facilities analagous to those of the caption package, when writing captions for subfigures and the like.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/subcaption

rotating   
    A package built on the standard LATEX graphics package to perform all the different sorts of rotation one might like, including complete figures and tables with their captions.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/rotating

booktabs   
    The package enhances the quality of tables in LATEX, providing extra commands as well as behind-the-scenes optimisation. Guidelines are given as to what constitutes a good table in this context. From version 1.61, the package offers longtable compatibility.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs

multicol   
    Multicol defines a multicols environment which typesets text in multiple columns (up to a maximum of 10), and (by default) balances the end of each column at the end of the environment. The package enables you to switch between any (permitted) number of columns at will: there is no imposed “clear page” operation, as there is in unadorned LATEX at a switch between \onecolumn and \twocolumn sections. The multicolumn environment can also be used inside a box, thus allowing multicolumned insets in text.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/multicol

multirow   
    The package has a lot of flexibility, including an option for specifying an entry at the “natural” width of its text.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/multirow

amsmath   
    The principal package in the AMS-LATEX distribution. It adapts for use in LATEX most of the mathematical features found in AMS-TEX; it is highly recommended as an adjunct to serious mathematical typesetting in LATEX.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/amsmath

amsfonts   
    An extended set of fonts for use in mathematics, including: extra mathematical symbols; blackboard bold letters (uppercase only); fraktur letters; subscript sizes of bold math italic and bold Greek letters; subscript sizes of large symbols such as sum and product; added sizes of the Computer Modern small caps font; cyrillic fonts (from the University of Washington); Euler mathematical fonts. All fonts are provided as Adobe Type 1 files, and all except the Euler fonts are provided as METAFONT source.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/amsfonts

amssymb   
    
    

pdflscape   
    The package adds PDF support to the landscape environment of package lscape, by setting the PDF /Rotate page attribute. Pages with this attribute will be displayed in landscape orientation by conforming PDF viewers.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/pdflscape

textcomp   
    The package supports the Text Companion fonts, which provide many text symbols (such as baht, bullet, copyright, musicalnote, onequarter, section, and yen), in the TS1 encoding.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/textcomp

longtable   
    Longtable allows you to write tables that continue to the next page. You can write captions within the table (typically at the start of the table), and headers and trailers for pages of table. Longtable arranges that the columns on successive pages have the same widths. This last contrasts with the superficially similar supertabular package.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/longtable

listings   
    The package enables the user to typeset programs (programming code) within LATEX; the source code is read directly by TEX—no front-end processor is needed. Keywords, comments and strings can be typeset using different styles (default is bold for keywords, italic for comments and no special style for strings). Support for hyperref is provided.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/listings

pdfpages
    This package simplifies the inclusion of external multi-page PDF documents in LATEX documents. Pages may be freely selected and similar to psnup it is possible to put several logical pages onto each sheet of paper. Furthermore a lot of hypertext features like hyperlinks and article threads are provided. The package supports pdfTEX (pdfLATEX) and VTEX. With VTEX it is even possible to use this package to insert PostScript files, in addition to PDF files.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/pdfpages

xparse   
    The package provides a high-level interface for producing document-level commands. In that way, it offers a replacement for LATEX2ε’s \newcommand macro, with significantly improved functionality.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/xparse

ifthen   
    The package's basic command is \ifthenelse, which can use a wide array of tests. Also provided is a simple loop command \whiledo.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/ifthen

hyphenat   
    This package can disable all hyphenation or enable hyphenation of non-alphabetics or monospaced fonts. The package can also enable hyphenation within ‘words’ that contain non-alphabetic characters (e.g., that include underscores), and hyphenation of text typeset in monospaced (e.g., cmtt) fonts.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/hyphenat

hyperref   
    The hyperref package is used to handle cross-referencing commands in LATEX to produce hypertext links in the document. The package provides backends for the \special set defined for HyperTEX DVI processors; for embedded pdfmark commands for processing by Acrobat Distiller (dvips and Y&Y’s dvipsone); for Y&Y’s dviwindo; for PDF control within pdfTEX and dvipdfm; for TEX4ht; and for VTEX’s pdf and HTML backends.
    https://ctan.org/pkg/hyperref

cleveref   
    The package enhances LATEX’s cross-referencing features, allowing the format of references to be determined automatically according to the type of reference. The formats used may be customised in the preamble of a document; babel support is available (though the choice of languages remains limited: currently Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Russian, Spanish and Ukranian).
    https://ctan.org/pkg/cleveref

inputenc
    The package translates various standard and other input encodings into a ‘LATEX internal language’. The internal language is expressed entirely in TEX's base encoding (standard ASCII printable characters, carriage control tokens and TEX control sequences, the latter mostly defined by LATEX).
    https://ctan.org/pkg/inputenc
