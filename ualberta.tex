  % OPTIONS FOR ualberta.cls:
  % chapterbib - Automatically prints references at the end of each chapter.
  % 
  % pdfa - To convert the PDF to PDF/A format (REQUIRED for GPS Submission)
  % 
  % oneside - Standard for submitting to GPS.
  % 
  % twoside - If you want to print your thesis double sided like a novel.
  % 
  % saychapapp - If you want your thesis to say Chapter # and Appendix @ in the  
  %               ToC instead of just having the # or @.
  %               (GPS is inconsistent on if this is truly a Requirement.)
  % 
  % fancyheader - If you want your thesis to have chapter headers rather than 
  %               just a page number at the bottom.

% Option to change the Level of subheading included in the Table of Contents
%  This should be set at 2, 3, or 4 (As per GPS)
