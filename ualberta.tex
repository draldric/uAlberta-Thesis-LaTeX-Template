\documentclass[
	pdfa,

	saychapapp,
	fancyheaders]{ualberta}
	% OPTIONS FOR ualberta.cls:
	% chapterbib - Automatically prints references at the end of each chapter.
	% 
	% pdfa - To convert the PDF to PDF/A format (REQUIRED for GPS Submission)
	% 
	% oneside - Standard for submitting to GPS.
	% 
	% twoside - If you want to print your thesis double sided like a novel. Note:
	%            GPS requires the submission to be one sided. Please use the 
	%            option `oneside' for submission to GPS.
	% 
	% saychapapp - If you want your thesis to say Chapter # and Appendix @ in the  
	%               ToC instead of just having the # or @.
	%               (GPS is inconsistent on if this is truly a Requirement.)
	% 
	% fancyheader - If you want your thesis to have chapter headers rather than 
	%               just a page number at the bottom.

% Option to change the Level of subheading included in the Table of Contents
%  This should be set at 2, 3, or 4 (As per GPS)
