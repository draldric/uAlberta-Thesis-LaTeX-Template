% ABSTRACT
  \abstracttext{%
    A thesis must have an abstract. 
    The abstract comes after the title page and is marked page ``ii''.

    The abstract is a concise and accurate summary of the thesis. 
    It states the problem that was researched, the methods of investigation, and the general conclusions. 
    An abstract must not contain non-text content, such as tables, graphs, complex equations, or illustrations.
    Even for theses containing journal articles, there is one single abstract for the entire work, included within the preliminary pages (front pages) of the thesis.

    For any thesis that is permitted to be written in a language other than English, two abstracts must be included; the first in English and the second in the language of the thesis.

    The font used for the abstract must be at least a 10 point font, with the text double-spaced, to ensure readability. 
    A strict maximum word count of 700 words applies, regardless of whether the abstract is for a master's or a doctoral degree (many abstracts are 300--500 words).

    For refernece this section is exactly one-hundred and seventy-six words.
	}

% PREFACE
  % Requirements
  \preface{
    \textbf{If you need assistance on writing the preface, ask your supervisor.
    Your supervisor must review and verify the preface before it becomes part of the final version of the thesis.}

    A preface is a mandatory component of a thesis, regardless of thesis format, \underline{when} a thesis contains journal articles authored or co-authored by the student (including an accepted paper that is forthcoming at the time of thesis submission). 
    A preface is \underline{also} a mandatory component when the research conducted for the thesis required ethics approval. 
    A preface remains optional if there is no inclusion of journal articles and/or no need for ethics approval.
    
    When required because a thesis contains journal articles, the preface serves as a place for the student to include a statement indicating his or her contribution to the journal articles, such as the identification and design of the research program, the performance of the various parts of the research (including the collection of data, construction of any necessary apparatus, and the performance of experiments), and the analysis of the research data. 
    If any of the work presented in the thesis has led to any publications (accepted or published), these publications must be listed clearly in the preface with their bibliographical details and an indication as to where in the thesis this work is located (e.g. state in which chapter or chapters). 
    For jointly authored publications, indication must also be given as to the relative contributions of the collaborators and co-authors, and a statement as to the proportion of research and writing conducted by the student. 
    Note that permission may be needed if the co-authors hold the copyright in these publications. 
    If ethics approval was required for the research, a statement to this effect must be included in the preface with the details of the approval that was granted. 
    
    Note that the inclusion of a preface does not excuse a student from failing to acknowledge the contributions of others in the body of the thesis, as per the University's Research and Scholarship Integrity Policy and the Code of Student Behaviour. One would still expect to see footnotes, endnotes or in-text references within the thesis acknowledging the works. Acknowledgments, such as thanks to the supervisor and supervisory committee members, to colleagues, lab mates and friends, and to family, do not appear in the preface. 
    
    \textbf{Examples of several prefaces are given in Appendix B and are also available from the FGSR website.}
   }
   
  % Optional

% ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
	\acknowledgementtext{%
		An Acknowledgements page (no more than 2 pages in length) is a recommended, but not mandatory, component of a thesis.
		
		The Acknowledgements page serves as a place within a thesis where students may wish to acknowledge the provision of funding from third parties, such as an external scholarship bodies, research granting agencies, and foreign governments. 
		It is also appropriate to recognize the assistance provided by the supervisor and members of the supervisory committee.
		
    \latin{e.g. } I would like to thank Daniel R. Aldrich for his continuing contributions to the University of Alberta, and for his work within the graduate student community. More specifically, I would like to acknowledge the work that he put into creating the \LaTeX{} template that this thesis was created in, and the ongoing support that he provides to the students at the University of Alberta.

% Though the following chapters are written in this tex file, it is highly recommened to 
%   separate chapters into their own files. 
\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:Introduction}
  The first page of the introduction is marked as page ``1'' and then the pages that follow are numbered sequentially.

  The minimum academic requirements for the text of a thesis are an introduction, followed by the presentation of the research in a manner suitable for the field, and a conclusion.

  The introduction must outline the thesis, problem, hypothesis, questions or goals of the research.
  It must provide a clear statement of the research question(s).
  The conclusion must highlight the student’s contribution to knowledge, providing conclusions with respect to the problem, hypothesis or goals of the research.
  In all theses, regardless of format, the body or chapters of the thesis contain methodology, research results, and scholarly discussion in accordance with the norms of the academic discipline.

  The University of Alberta encourages students to publish.
  Thus, one or more chapters of a thesis may contain published material if permitted by the regulations of your department (or Faculty if non-departmentalized) governing your specific degree program.
  It is a matter for individual graduate programs to develop specific guidance for students and supervisors, as well as supervisory committee members, with such specific guidance likely to reflect the needs of the particular field or academic discipline.

  For example, individual graduate programs that continue to prefer the traditional monograph-style thesis may have department-specific rules on such matters as maximum length (taking into account the burden on an external examiner to read a thesis that is over 100,000 words).
  Individual graduate programs that opt for a multiple-manuscript or journal-article format, or choose to accept both traditional and paper-based formats, or a combination of both, must have department-specific guidelines in place to address potential student and supervisor queries.
  For example, the department-specific guidance needs to address what counts as a publication (\latin{e.g. } self-publication, any journal, or only journals listed in a particular source); whether a paper-based thesis can include both published and accepted papers; whether the student must be the first author for a multiple-authored publication to be acceptable for inclusion within the thesis; and whether some form of connecting text is needed to link the papers beyond the introduction (and if so, what form or forms of connectors are acceptable).

  % \printreferences Prints a reference section at the end of the current chapter

  % If the `chapterbib' option is not declaired, \printreferences does nothing
  %    This allows you to turn end of chapter references on and off easily.
  %
  % Note: End of chapter references share references with the Bibliography that
  %    is REQUIRED at the end of your thesis, so the numbering of the end of 
  %    chapter references may not start at 1 and may not increment by one.
